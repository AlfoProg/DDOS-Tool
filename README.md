# DDOS-Tool
DDos-Tool it's my first seriously project written on bash!
It script works only on LINUX.
It script starts DDos attack on site you'd like.
It download Xerxes DDos tool (if it's missing), and ask you what site would you like to attack.
(P.S.) It DDos attack is very poor and 'kill' only easy sites.
How to use?
To start it: 
1) Open the terminal 
2) Input line "bash ddos.sh" 
3) Script ask you'd like to download ddos tool xerxes
4) When file downloaded script ask you what site would you like to attack
5) Script starts attack, to stop press Ctrl+C
